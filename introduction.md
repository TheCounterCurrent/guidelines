# Counter Current Contributor Guidelines

When we started Counter Current, we simply were two siblings, one a senior in college and the other a recent graduate, on winter break. We quickly gathered a few friends, ranging from liberal arts schools to military service academies, who all deeply cared about the environment just like we did. In the past month, Counter Current has gathered a huge following and has grown from us simply sharing our environmental concerns to becoming an environmental media platform giving a voice to our planet!

Counter Current offers a place for students and recent graduates to share their ideas and thoughts on environmental issues arrising in politics, industries, media platforms, and culture. Our targetted audience is for everyone who cares about the environment and want to make a change. We also encourage our audience to include those who maybe aren't sure climate change is caused by our impact, by emphasizing that our difference and green consumer behavior can help reduce waste and heal our planet, animals, and us in the process. We hope to be a new home for you to feel comfortable with the new changes and green choices you make.

While we have a structure in place for our editorial and media departments, we wish to be open by the influences of our team collectively through our vision, site, and focus. This includes you! Not only are you a "contributor" to Counter Current, you are a valuable asset to our community and planet. Although we come very diverse backgrounds, have very diverse political and social views, we all work together, including those perspectives, to achieve great results. Counter Current is for you and what you decide to do with the new information. It's what you make of it.

With this guide, we hope that we can give you a sense of what Counter Current is about, our expectations of you, and how we can help make sure you contribute your best effort. We hope to cover everything ranging from our ideological standpoints to specific details of our management.
