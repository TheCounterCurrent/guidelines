# Article Guidelines

Your articles should be written with the intent of educating readers in a neutral way, rather than condeming the opposing ideological view. Do not make attacks including, but not limitted to: bashing non climate change believers, meat eaters, nonvegans; agriculture, automobile, or oil companies; other eco-conscious gurus, companies, or nonprofits. If your piece is very opinionated and negative towards the other stance, we will reject it. If your piece is written in a purposeful way seeking a retweet or follow from a specific eco organization or figure you admire, we will ask you to rewrite it.  

We always appreciate first hand experiences, article reviews, or highlighted eco-gurus/products, but we expect you to be rational and level-headed. If the purpose of your piece is meant to protray yourself as a hero and everyone else ignorant, we will ask you to rewrite your piece.

In short, we DO NOT want your article to be bipartisan, but to be informative. Otherwise, _we will ask you to rewrite your piece_.

You should ask yourself why you are writing your article in the first place. _What is the long term intent of your writing?_ If the answer is to build a following, run a campaign, become politically or militarily involved, _is what you are writing something that could limit those future goals?_

As many of our top leadership are connected with military and government entities, we cannot accept pieces that endorse or reject specific political activity. If a candidate does something noteworthy for or against the enviornment, it may be mentioned in the article and explained, but an article cannot intently support or offer an impression of supporting that candidate or a specific piece of the legislation. If the written article does, it will no longer be accepted.

For example, if a political figure, celebrity, or publicized candidate makes a statement about how terrible the meat industry is, this by itself is not newsworthy as it is commonly said by others. If you are writing a piece about a new policy and make reference the candidate's statement, debate, or situation, then it may be okay if it is done objectively. Otherwise, if the candidate donates billions to an eco NGO, or has created a company in lieu of his/her beliefs, this is independently newsworthy.

We do not want a five-paragraph essay as taught in high school. We do not want academic essays. We want your work to be original and written with the idea it will be published. About 300 words is an ideal article length (**WE WILL NOT ACCEPT ARTICLES OVER 800 WORDS**). Your arguments should be well constructed and thoughtful as well.

Cite your sources! We do not want to plagarize, but we want you to be thoughtful and rational with evidence to support your piece. You can educate as much as you would like, but it WILL NOT be sufficient by relying soley on your own logic or experiences. We want to know how you came up with your claims or conclusions based on external sources.

Citations should be present as inline links within your article. If you are citing an offline source, then mention it within your article (the name and author). Have your citations be organized in a way that you would expect a published version to be presented. 

We check every submission for plagiarism, and if such evidence is found, we will automatically remove you from the Counter Current contributor team.


## News vs. Opinion

If you are writing a news piece or covering a specific incident, your opinion should not belong in the article. Rather, it should contain facts and objective content. The words "I" and "me" do not belong in the article unless it is contained in a quote. 

Loaded words or phrases such as "shameful" or "repulsive" signals bias in the news piece. Again, your personal opinion, which is sensed in these loaded words and phrases, do not belong in a factual article unless they are quotes. If you submit a news piece with apparent bias, we will have you revise your work.

Our readers care and they are aware of climate change. They can interpret facts for themselves and you must understand and respect that disagreements with your personal opinions may exist. Recieving hatemail is apart of growing publically. 


## Feeling Stuck?

Ask us for help! If you aren't sure about your idea, don't be afraid to pitch it. We might think it is actually very good or that our audience would benefit from that perspective. There is no competition with who makes the best or most articles, so produce quality work in a timely manner. We will reward those that stand out amongst our contributor team. Additionally, many times we collaborate on articles behind the scenes, so don't be afraid to ask for help if you're stuck. 

We understand that your thought process while writing can get you so far. If you are stuck halfway through, don't give up. Even if you are not sure what to do with the topic, maybe another team member can pick up where you left off. 

We're in this together and want to produce the best work we can. 


## Publishing Requirements

Please send your articles and pitch ideas via email through the \# About\Join page on our website. Your pitched ideas must be approved before we can accept your article.

**For existing contributors**, please add a task in the Articles board in Trello with the main topic of your article and assign it to yourself. We like to see what everyone is working on to balance out topics.

All articles should be submitted as a Google Doc, shared with [waverly@thecountercurrent.com](mailto:waverly@thecountercurrent.com). If you have Trello access, link this Google Doc to your article's card.

If you wish to use pictures or graphs, please make sure we get a .png, .jpg version of them. Send these via email or on the document. 

Once you submit your article, it will be sent to the editors to review. We may or may not follow up on the edits before publication, depending on how much substance is changed or added. However, we will do our best and definitely let you know when it is published. 


## Article Ownership

Upon publishing a piece by Counter Current, we take full ownership of that specific piece of work. This is a standard procedure for publications. While we claim ownership of the article, the ideas are owned by you. If you wish to write another article that is separate but derived from the article we published, we cannot claim it.

As explained in our contributor contract, you may republish your own articles in a personal blog or social media. However, you must mention that the source of the article was published originally on Counter Current and include the link to that piece on our website.

If your article appears in any other publication without our permission after it has been published on Counter Current, we will take action to request its removal and if necessary, follow up with a legal pursuit.

If your pitch or article is rejected by us, you are free to send it to any other publication with no hard feelings. Please notify us though so we avoid confusion. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know. We are happy to talk to you about them.


## Time Sensitivity

If your article is deemed time senstive, you should mark it as such so that our editing team will turn it around as fast as possible. 
	- Time sensitive status means that the article must be published in the next three days. Priority status 
	- Priority status means the article must be published within the next week.
 **Failure to notify us of the status can result in us rejecting the article submission.**


## Our Editorial Process

When you submit your article via email, we will post it on our Google Drive for review by the editorial team. Our Editor in Chief will internally assign editors to review your article as needed.

If you need to make changes during editorial review, _please do not make further revisions to it_. Rather, please contact Waverly if a change needs to be made. 

The article will be published at the discretion of the Editor in Chief. Most of the time we will notify you after the publication as the decision to publish is made last minute. Most articles will be published around noon, 12:00 PM EST.
