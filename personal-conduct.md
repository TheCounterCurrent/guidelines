# Personal Conduct

Although Counter Current is accepting of different political views, we do require a set of standards for our contributors.

We expect you to be respectful and professional, especially in internal communications such as email/Facebook/Slack/Trello/Instagram. Remember that other contributors may come up with different conclusions and have different perspectives. 

If you are a published contributor and have already publically affiliated yourself with Counter Current on social media or elsewhere, we expect a basic level of professionalism from you. If your social media or other places are full of vulgur, inappropriate content or content that negatively impacts Counter Current's image, we will not feature you in our Contributor social media list or link your social media accounts to our articles. If you attack, harrass, or are vulgur to your contributors, publically or internally, we reserve the right to remove you as a contributor. While we agree with the freedom of expression, we want you to take responsibility to limit your public and private actions or speech from being inappropriate or harmful to our company. Otherwise, we will discuss your conduct with you and remove you as a contributor.

Basically, we ask that you respect and adhere to our stance that eco-conscious consumers are looking for role models, level-headed contributors, and partisan information.
